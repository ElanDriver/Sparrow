Elan Ektf3xx series touch controller
	
	Required properties:
      
		- compatible			: Should be "elan,ektf"
		- reg					: I2C slave address of the device.
		- interrupt-parent		: Parent of interrupt.
		- interrupts			: Configuration of touch panel controller interrupt
									GPIO.
		- elan,irq-gpio			: Interrupt gpio which is to provide interrupts to 
									host, same as "interrupts" node.It will also contain 
									active low or active high information
		- elan,reset-gpio		: Reset gpio to control the reset of chip.

	
	Optional properties:
		
		- vdd-supply			: Power supply needed to power up the device, when use
									external regulator, do not add this property.
		-vcc-i2c-supply			: Power source required to power up i2c bus.
									Ektf3xx series can provide 1.8V from internal
									LDO, add this properties base on hardware design.
	
	Example:
		i2c@f9923000{
			elan_ktf@10 {
				compatible = "elan,ektf";
				reg = <0x10>;
				vdd-supply = <&pm8110_l19>;
				vcc_i2c-supply = <&pm8110_l14>;
				elan,reset-gpio = <&msmgpio 0 0x00>;
				elan,irq-gpio = <&msmgpio 1 0x00>;
				interrupt-parent = <&msmgpio>;
				interrupts = <1 0x2>;
			};
		};
